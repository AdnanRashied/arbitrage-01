# Arbitrage - 001
Exploring fast pace web application for arbitraging crypto currencies between the most popular exchanges. 001 falls under my exploration of newer front-end technologies 

## Goal
I wanted to use this codebase to explore the best overall GUI to show each element of crypto currency. As of now, I am deciding the best way to show multiple exchanges, whether using a list format for each coin or a tile format listing each exchange.
The tile based GUI gives an aesthetic look, however lacks the relative speed of having all information on screen. A list search will perform faster on displaying information than a tile, while offering more screen real-estate.
